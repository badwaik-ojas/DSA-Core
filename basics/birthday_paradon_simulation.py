'''
The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room
will have the same birthday is more than half, provided n, the number of
people in the room, is more than 23. This property is not really a paradox,
but many people find it surprising. Design a Python program that can test
this paradox by a series of experiments on randomly generated birthdays,
which test this paradox for n = 5,10,15,20, . . . ,100.

âœ… Features:

Simulates 1000 experiments for each group size.
Uses random birthdays between day 0 and 364 (ignores leap years for simplicity).
Calculates the probability of at least one shared birthday.
Tests the paradox for values of n = 5 to 100 in steps of 5.
