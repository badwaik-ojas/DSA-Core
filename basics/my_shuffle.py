'''
Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function shuffle(data) that accepts a
list of elements and randomly reorders the elements so that each possible
order occurs with equal probability. The random module includes a
more basic function randint(a, b) that returns a uniformly random integer
from a to b (including both endpoints). Using only the randint function,
implement your own version of the shuffle function.

import random

def my_shuffle(data):
    n = len(data)
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        j = random.randint(0, i)
        data[i], data[j] = data[j], data[i]

items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_shuffle(items)
print(items)  # List will be shuffled randomly
