'''
Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n
integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they
were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
for doing the same thing.

def reverse_list(l):
    n = len(l)
    for x in range(n//2):
        l[x], l[n-1-x] = l[n-1-x], l[x]
    return l

l1 = [2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 0]

# with built-in function
l1 = [2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 0]
